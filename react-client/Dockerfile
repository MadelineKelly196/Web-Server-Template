COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the appâ€™s source code
COPY . .

# Build the app

# Step 2: Use an Nginx image to serve the static files

# Copy the build files from the builder stage to the Nginx web directory
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default NGINX port
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
